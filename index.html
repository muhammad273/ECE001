Operating System : 
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
An operating system, or "OS," is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run. 
It is comprised of system software, or the fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. 
Every desktop computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides basic functionality for the device.
Common desktop operating systems include Windows, OS X, and Linux. 
While each OS is different, most provide a graphical user interface, or GUI, that includes a desktop and the ability to manage files and folders. 
They also allow you to install and run programs written for the operating system. 
Windows and Linux can be installed on standard PC hardware, while OS X is designed to run on Apple systems. 
Therefore, the hardware you choose affects what operating system(s) you can run.
Mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones also include operating systems that provide a GUI and can run applications. 
Common mobile OSes include Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. 
These OSes are developed specifically for portable devices and therefore are designed around touchscreen input. 
While early mobile operating systems lacked many features found in desktop OSes, they now include advanced capabilities, such as the ability to run third-party apps and run multiple apps at once.
Since the operating system serves as a computer's fundamental user interface, it significantly affects how you interact with the device. 
Therefore, many users prefer to use a specific operating system. 
For example, one user may prefer to use a computer with OS X instead of a Windows-based PC.
Another user may prefer an Android-based smartphone instead of an iPhone, which runs the iOS.
When software developers create applications, they must write and compile them for a specific operating system. 
This is because each OS communicates with the hardware differently and has a specific application program interface, or API, that the programmer must use. 
While many popular programs are crossplatform, meaning they have been developed for multiple OSes, some are only available for a single operating system. 
Therefore, when choosing a computer, make sure the operating system supports the programs you want to run.

  Why use an operating system? 
<font color ="black" size="5">
<br>
An operating system brings powerful benefits to computer software and software development. 
Without an operating system, every application would need to include its own UI, as well as the comprehensive code needed to handle all low-level functionality of the underlying computer, 
such as disk storage, network interfaces and so on. 
Considering the vast array of underlying hardware available, this would vastly bloat the size of every application and make software development impractical.
Instead, many common tasks, such as sending a network packet or displaying text on a standard output device, such as a display, can be offloaded to system software that serves as an intermediary between the applications and the hardware. 
The system software provides a consistent and repeatable way for applications to interact with the hardware without the applications needing to know any details about the hardware.
As long as each application accesses the same resources and services in the same way, that system software -- the operating system -- can service almost any number of applications. 
This vastly reduces the amount of time and coding required to develop and debug an application, while ensuring that users can control, configure and manage the system hardware through a common and well-understood interface.
Once installed, the operating system relies on a vast library of device drivers to tailor OS services to the specific hardware environment. 
Thus, every application may make a common call to a storage device, but the OS receives that call and uses the corresponding driver to translate the call into actions (commands) needed for the underlying hardware on that specific computer. 
Today, the operating system provides a comprehensive platform that identifies, configures and manages a range of hardware, including processors; memory devices and memory management; chipsets; storage; networking; port communication, 
such as Video Graphics Array (VGA), High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) and Universal Serial Bus (USB); and subsystem interfaces, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe).

*Functions of an operating system:
 <br>
<font color="black" size="5">
An operating system provides three essential capabilities:
<br> 
It offers a UI through a CLI or GUI; it launches and manages the application execution; and it identifies and exposes system hardware resources to those applications -- typically, 
 through a standardized API.
UI. Every operating system requires a UI, enabling users and administrators to interact with the OS in order to set up, configure and even troubleshoot the operating system and its underlying hardware. 
<br>
There are two primary types of UI available:
<br>
 CLI and GUI.
<br>
.The GUI is most frequently used by casual or end users that are primarily interested in manipulating files and applications, 
such as double-clicking a file icon to open the file in its default application
<br>. 
.The CLI remains popular among advanced users and system administrators that must handle a series of highly granular and repetitive commands on a regular basis, 
such as creating and running scripts to set up new personal computers (PCs) for employees.
<br>
<font color="green" size="7">
*Application management:
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
An operating system handles the launch and management of every application. 
This typically supports an array of behaviors, including timesharing multiple processes, or threads, 
so that various tasks can share the available processors' time; handling interruptions that applications produce to gain a processor's immediate attention, 
ensuring there is enough memory to execute the application and its corresponding data without interfering with other processes; 
carrying out error handling that can gracefully remove an application's processes; and performing memory management without disrupting other applications or the OS.
An operating system can also support APIs that enable applications to utilize OS and hardware functions without the need to know anything about the low-level OS or hardware state. 
As an example, a Windows API can enable a program to obtain input from a keyboard or mouse; create GUI elements, such as dialog windows and buttons; read and write files to a storage device; and more. 
Applications are almost always tailored to use the operating system on which the application intends to run.
Additionally, an operating system can perform the following services for applications:
<br>
•In a multitasking operating system, where multiple programs can be running at the same time, 
the OS determines which applications should run in what order and how much time should be allowed for each application before giving another application a turn.
<br>
•It handles input/output (I/O) to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers and dial-up ports.
<br>
•It sends messages to each application or interactive user -- or to a system operator -- about the status of operation and any errors that may have occurred.
<br>
•It can offload the management of batch jobs -- for example, printing -- so that the initiating application is freed from this work.
<br>
•On computers that can provide parallel processing, an operating system can manage how to divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.
All major computer platforms (hardware and software) require, and sometimes include, 
an operating system, and operating systems must be developed with different features to meet the specific needs of various form factors.
<br>
<font color="green" size="7">
*Device management:
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
An operating system is responsible for identifying, configuring, and providing applications with common access to underlying computer hardware devices. 
As the OS recognizes and identifies hardware, the OS will install corresponding device drivers that enable the OS and applications running on the OS to use the devices without any specific knowledge of the hardware or devices.
An operating system is responsible for identifying the correct printer and installing the appropriate printer drivers 
so that an application needs to only make calls to the printer without having to use codes or commands that are specific to that printer -- that is the operating system's job. 
The situation is similar for other devices, such as USB ports; networking ports; graphics devices, 
such as graphics processing units (GPUs); motherboard chipsets; and storage devices, 
such as Serial-Attached SCSI (SAS) disk adapters and disks that are formatted with a suitable file system.
The OS identifies and configures physical and logical devices for service and typically records them in a standardized structure, 
such as Windows Registry. Device manufacturers periodically patch and update drivers, and the OS should update them to ensure best device performance and security. 
When devices are replaced, the OS also installs and configures new drivers.

*Operating system types:
<br>
<font color="blue" size="6"> 
1. Batch Operating System –
<br> 
<font color="black" size="5">
This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. 
There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them into batches. 
It is the responsibility of the operator to sort jobs with similar needs.
<br> 
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Advantages of Batch Operating System:
<br> 
 <font color="black" size="5">
•It is very difficult to guess or know the time required for any job to complete. 
Processors of the batch systems know how long the job would be when it is in queue
<br>
•Multiple users can share the batch systems
<br>
•The idle time for the batch system is very less
<br>
•It is easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Disadvantages of Batch Operating System:  
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
•The computer operators should be well known with batch systems
<br>
•Batch systems are hard to debug
<br>
•It is sometimes costly
<br>
•The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails
<br>
"Examples of Batch based Operating System":
<br>
 Payroll System, Bank Statements, etc.
<br> 
 <font color="blue" size="6">
2. Time-Sharing Operating Systems – 
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly.
Each user gets the time of CPU as they use a single system.
These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. 
The task can be from a single user or different users also.
 The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum.
 After this time interval is over OS switches over to the next task. 
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Advantages of Time-Sharing OS:
<br>  
<font color="black" size="5">
•Each task gets an equal opportunity
<br>
•Fewer chances of duplication of software
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Disadvantages of Time-Sharing OS:
<br>  
<font color="black" size="5">
•Reliability problem
<br>
•One must have to take care of the security and integrity of user programs and data
<br>
•Data communication problem
<br>
"Examples of Time-Sharing OSs are":
<br>
 Multics, Unix, etc.
 <br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
3. Distributed Operating System – 
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
These types of the operating system is a recent advancement in the world of computer technology and are being widely accepted all over the world and, 
that too, with a great pace. Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate with each other using a shared communication network. 
Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred to as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. 
These system’s processors differ in size and function. 
The major benefit of working with these types of the operating system is that it is always possible that one user can access the files or software which are not actually present on his system but some other system connected within this network i.e., remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network. 
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Advantages of Distributed Operating System:  
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
•Failure of one will not affect the other network communication, as all systems are independent from each other
<br>
•Electronic mail increases the data exchange speed
<br>
•Since resources are being shared, computation is highly fast and durable
<br>
•Load on host computer reduces
<br>
•These systems are easily scalable as many systems can be easily added to the network
<br>
•Delay in data processing reduces
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Disadvantages of Distributed Operating System:  
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
•Failure of the main network will stop the entire communication
<br>
•To establish distributed systems the language which is used are not well defined yet
<br>
•These types of systems are not readily available as they are very expensive. 
<br>
Not only that the underlying software is highly complex and not understood well yet 
<br>
"Examples of Distributed Operating System ":
<br>
are- LOCUS, etc. 
<br>
<font color="blue" size="6">
4. Network Operating System – 
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, 
and other networking functions. 
<br>
These types of operating systems allow shared access of files, printers, security, applications, 
and other networking functions over a small private network. 
<br>
One more important aspect of Network Operating Systems is that all the users are well aware of the underlying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual connections, etc. 
<br>
and that’s why these computers are popularly known as tightly coupled systems. 
 <br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Advantages of Network Operating System:  
 <br>
<font color="black" size="5">
•Highly stable centralized servers
<br>
•Security concerns are handled through servers
<br>
•New technologies and hardware up-gradation are easily integrated into the system
<br>
•Server access is possible remotely from different locations and types of systems 
<br>
 <font color="blue" size="6">
-Disadvantages of Network Operating System:  
<br>
<font color="black" size="5">
•Servers are costly
<br>
•User has to depend on a central location for most operations
<br>
•Maintenance and updates are required regularly
<br>
"Examples of Network Operating System are": 
<br>
Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, and BSD, etc.
